# Scout Management System - Real-Time Transformation

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure

- ⬜️ EventDetailModal.tsx
- ⬜️ PermissionSlipModal.tsx
- ⬜️ RsvpCard.tsx

### Additional Features

- ⬜️ Optimistic UI updates for all CRUD operations
- ⬜️ Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ⬜️ Better user feedback for connection status
- ⬜️ Comprehensive reconnection logic
- ⬜️ Offline mode support with data synchronization

## Current Application Status

- The application now supports real-time features for messaging, scout management, and event tracking.
- Pages that have been updated show connection status indicators and use real-time data.
- The system gracefully falls back to mock data when API requests fail, ensuring a smooth transition.
- User presence is tracked and displayed in the UI.
- Socket connection status is visible to users.

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating the remaining pages to use real-time data and socket context
2. Implement optimistic UI updates for all user actions
3. Add more robust error handling and reconnection logic
4. Implement comprehensive user presence indicators
5. Complete end-to-end testing with multiple users

## How to Test

To test the real-time functionality:
1. Open the application in multiple browser windows or devices
2. Log in as different user types (parent, leader, executive)
3. Send messages between users to see real-time updates
4. Make changes to scouts, events, or documents and observe real-time propagation
5. Test disconnection scenarios by toggling network access
