# MSA Portal - Supabase Migration Status

## Current Status ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

Your MSA Portal has been successfully connected to Supabase, but the database schema needs to be completed.

## What's Working ✅

- **Supabase Connection**: Successfully connected to your Supabase project
- **Environment Variables**: All Supabase credentials are configured in `.env`
- **Groups Table**: Successfully created and populated with 5 scout groups:
  - Joeys (Ages 5-7)
  - Cubs (Ages 8-10) 
  - Scouts (Ages 11-14)
  - Venturers (Ages 15-17)
  - Rovers (Ages 18-25)

## What Needs to be Done ⚠️

### 1. Complete Database Schema
Most tables are missing from your Supabase database. You need to run the SQL migration:

**File**: `supabase/create-missing-tables.sql`

**Steps**:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/create-missing-tables.sql`
4. Execute the SQL script

This will create:
- `users` table
- `scouts` table  
- `applications` table
- `attendances` table
- `badges` table
- `badge_scouts` table
- `files` table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexes for performance

### 2. Fix Existing Table Schemas
The existing `events` and `announcements` tables have different structures than expected:

**Events Table Issues**:
- Missing `start_date` column
- Missing `end_date` column
- Missing `created_by` column

**Announcements Table Issues**:
- Missing `priority` column

### 3. Update Application Code
After fixing the database schema, you'll need to update your application code to use Supabase instead of Prisma:

**Files to update**:
- `app/api/**/*.ts` (all API routes)
- `lib/services/**/*.ts` (data services)
- `components/**/*.tsx` (components that fetch data)

**Replace**:
```typescript
// Old Prisma code
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
```

**With**:
```typescript
// New Supabase code
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
const { data: users } = await supabase.from('users').select('*');
```

## Files Created/Updated 📁

### Configuration Files
- `.env` - Updated with Supabase credentials
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration

### Database Files
- `supabase/migration.sql` - Original complete schema
- `supabase/create-missing-tables.sql` - Missing tables only
- `scripts/seed-final.js` - Working seed script

### Documentation
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - This file

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Run the missing tables migration** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Fix the existing table schemas** (events and announcements)
3. **Run the seed script** again after tables are created:
   ```bash
   node scripts/seed-final.js
   ```
4. **Update your application code** to use Supabase instead of Prisma
5. **Test the application** end-to-end

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your project dashboard
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure you have the right permissions in Supabase
4. Test individual queries in the Supabase SQL Editor

Your MSA Portal is well on its way to being fully migrated to Supabase! 🎉
